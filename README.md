# About
This repository contains all my solutions to the algorithm problems on several competitive
programming platforms( Codeforce, AtCoder etc.).

I created this repo mainly to help myself revise what I have learned. However, I think that it 
would be great if this repository can help beginners in competitive programming. So, I will 
try to make my code as clean as possible by not using any macro and giving each variable a 
proper name. Also, I try to add comments that explain what my algorithm does.
